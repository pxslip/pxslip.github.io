# Pesto Rolls

A savory cinnamon roll! Take your dinner rolls and make them better. This recipe leans heavily on King Arthur's [Japanese Milk Bread Roll](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/japanese-milk-bread-rolls-recipe) recipe for inspiration.

This recipe uses the starter or tangzhong method. This method has you create what is essentially a roux out of water, milk, and flour. The starter is then mixed into the final dough and helps them keep their texture and tenderness.

As with most baking I strongly encourage you to weigh your ingredients instead of measuring by volume. Your results will be more consistent.

## Ingredients

### Tangzhong/Starter
- 3 tablespoons (43g) water
- 3 tablespoons (43g) milk (preferrably whole)
- 2 tablespoons (14g) bread flour

### Dough
- 2 1/2 cups (300g) all-purpose flour
- 2 tablespoons (14g) Milk Powder
- 2 tablespoons (25g) granulated sugar
- 1 teaspoon (6g) table salt[*](#footnote-salt)
- 1 tablespoon instant yeast
- 1/2 cup (113g) milk (preferrably whole)
- 1 large egg
- 4 tablespoons (57g) unsalted butter, melted

## Instructions

### Making the Tangzhong/Starter

1. Measure the flour by gentling spooning it into the measuring tool and sweeping off any excess.
2. Add the water, milk, and flour to a small saucepan and mix until smooth.
3. Place the saucepan over low heat and cook, stirring constantly, until the mixture is thick, about 3 to 5 minutes.
4. Remove the mixture from heat and transfer to a bowl or other container to cool.

### Making the Dough

1. Measure the flour by gentling spooning it into the measuring tool and sweeping off any excess.
2. Combine tangzhong/starter with the remaining dough ingredients in the bowl of your stand mixer, bread machine, or a large bowl.
3. Mix and knead the ingredients using a stand mixer, a bread machine, or by hand until a smooth elastic dough forms. The dough should clean the sides of the bowl and be just tacky to the touch.
4. Shape the dough into a ball and place in a lightly greased, covered bowl to rise. The dough may not double, but should be puffy. This should take 60-90 minutes.
5.
